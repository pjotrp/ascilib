= ASCILIB =

A Science Lib (ASCILIB) is an initiative to  provide shared libraries for the
major high-level languages - so as to share one code base for Perl, Ruby,
Python, JAVA and R. ASciLib is related to BioLib:

  http://biolib.open-bio.org/

The basic idea is to provide infrastructure that allows sharing code rather
than reinventing the wheel every time between different language
implementations.

ASciLib provides a minimalistic layer to external C and C++ libraries - using
SWIG as the primary interface provider. 

For more information see:

The release notes are in ./doc/RELEASE_NOTES.txt

For dependencies see ./doc/DEPENDENCIES.txt
